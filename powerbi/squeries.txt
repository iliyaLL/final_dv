Write an SQL query on the database from task 1, which will display a list of those users who bought any animal feed for the period August 1-15, except "Kitekat cat food, with rabbit in sauce, 85 g". Attach it in a text document.

SELECT DISTINCT o.user_id
FROM orders o
JOIN order_lines ol ON o.order_id = ol.order_id
JOIN products p ON ol.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2017-08-01' AND '2017-08-15'
  AND p.category = 'Animal Feed'
  AND p.product_name != 'Kitekat cat food, with rabbit in sauce, 85 g'



Write an SQL query that will display a list of the top 5 most common products in user orders in St. Petersburg for the period August 15-30. Attach it in the same text document where you wrote the request from the previous paragraph.

SELECT p.product_name, COUNT(*) AS product_count
FROM orders o
JOIN order_lines ol ON o.order_id = ol.order_id
JOIN products p ON ol.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN warehouses w ON o.warehouse_id = w.warehouse_id
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2017-08-15' AND '2017-08-30'
  AND w.city = 'Saint Petersburg'
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY product_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
